## Error
raspi-config shows Unable to communicate with wpa_supplicant

First Check Locale (Language) Setting) if it is en.US
then your wpa_supplicant.conf file follows the same as country=US

then save it 

reload the service

sudo wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure


##Solution

I found wpa_supplicant to be super confusing to work with until I figured out how to see its debug messages by running it manually.

sudo killall wpa_supplicant
sudo wpa_supplicant -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0
(Add a -d onto the end to make it verbose.)

Until I figured this out, it was complete voodoo. Once you get the config file right, reboot to get the normal daemon back, it should work normally.


##SOlution #2

Modify wpa_supplicant file

If your output is Could not communicate with wpa_supplicant Then try and edit it.

Edit the wpa_supplicant.conf file

sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
Then add the following network information

network={
ssid="networkname"
psk="networkPassword"
}
See if you are then able to see the Networks on the top right of the display.
